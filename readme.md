<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About
## Overview
Levels is a full stack web app to manage aircraft cargo loading and weight and balance for US Air Force aircraft load masters, and aircraft maintenance. 

The first and second iterations were built with tech stacks that could not accredited and deployed to the Air Force network:

1. [5 Level](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v1-android) Native Android
2. [Five Level](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v2-flutter) Flutter
3. Levels - [UI Repo](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v3-react) [API Repo](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v2v3-express) 

Levels, is deployed and acreditied under the Department of Defense's DevSecOps initiative: [Platform One](https://software.af.mil/about/)

</p>

## About the UI
The frontend service has two main components. The dashboard and the admin portal.

The dashboard is for configuring a cargo load to perform aircraft weight and balance, and the admin portal is for performing CRUD operations on users, aircraft, configurations, and cargo.

Some interesting features of the UI are:
- Offline persistance of the dashboard
- Near real time sync between the dashboard and the server wile updating offline cache
- Real time admin portal
## About the api
The api is Restful interface that manages CRUD operations against multiple aircraft and user roles

some interesting features of the API are:
- JWT based user roles for each aircraft
- Local memory cache of common routes
- Logging
## System Architecture
The UI and api are deployed to Platform One's mission bootstrap cluster. It lives behind an an isto auth service that can use 2fa or a smart card.

# DevSecOps
## Platform One
P1 is the Department of Defence DevSecOps initiative to deploy and accredit cloud native apps. [Read more.](https://software.af.mil/team/platformone/) 
## Pipelines
Pipelines are initially built with help of app teams, and later manages by the DevSecOps team. Levels has 2 GitLab yml, [located here](https://code.il2.dso.mil/platform-one/devops/pipeline-products/-/tree/five-level-app/products/tron/products/five-level-app) that configure how the pipelines are run. 

Each service, api and ui have 17 stages before that must pass before a prod release can be made. This is a high level overview of reach stage. More info about what each stages does can be found [here](https://confluence.il2.dso.mil/display/P1PARTYBUS/HowTo+-+GitLab+-+Pipeline+Basics?src=contextnavpagetreemode). Also it may be helpful to enroll in the ["party bus"](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdVm3uZo_8PAt2aGivbj621DU02RROGGr8DsVb0QgRNLiDLw/viewform) to get more information about the stages and how they tie into accreditation 

## Certificate to Field
Platform one standardized certificate to field under the following conditions:
They standardize Certificate to Field and deployment with the following conditions:
- Containerized services that use hardened base imgs from the Iron Banks img registry
- 80% line code coverage
- TDD and XP development
- Usage of platforms ISTO Auth service
- Adhering to security standards under SD Elements, Fortify, Sonarqube, and limiting [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org)
- Passing pipelines

The current certificate to field must be renewed once a year, on June 24 2022, or when a new system architecture is created ex: another api service.

The certificate to field is only for 1 major version of the application 1.0.0 though 2.0.0. Minor, and patch releases must be made to avoid re certification!
## Auth DevSecOps
All requests within behind P1's auth service have a base64 encoded JWT with general information about a user. For more info about what inside, see the API's test utils file.

## UI DevSecOps
The UI img is deployed automatically to staging with a passing master branch, and may be deployed to production manually by the final pipeline stage.
## API DevSecOps
The api img take the argument IS_LOCAL. When IS_LOCAL is true, the api will reset the database and reseed. This is why a local e2e compose starts with a fresh DB, and the staging and prod apis persist the same DB.
## DB DevSecOps
Some cloud providers do not allow a shadow DB when Prisma pushes the schema into them. For more information see [the prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment) 

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Recommended: login to hardend docker registry to run hardened images. There are minor differences between open source images and the hardened images. For example the hardened images do not have sleep or mv.
```sh
docker login registry.il2.dso.mil -u $gitlab_ci_token -p $gitlab_token_string
```
5. Clone the [UI](https://code.il2.dso.mil/tron/products/five-level-app/frontend-react) and [API](https://code.il2.dso.mil/tron/products/five-level-app/api) from gitlab, or [UI](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v3-react) and [API](https://github.com/tsAppDevelopment/levels-v2v3-express) from github

6. cd frontend-react
## Compose Prod
To compose the production app run these within the frontend-react repo. Use :os at the end of these commands if you have not logged in to the hardened registry.

```sh
docker:build:fullstack
```

```sh
docker:up:halfstack
```
## Compose Dev
While developing locally, you may only want to run the api, db, and JWT proxy in a container so you can hot reload with React.Use :os at the end of these commands if you have not logged in to the hardened registry.

```sh
docker:build:halfstack
```

```sh
docker:up:fullstack
```

```sh
npm i
```

```sh
PORT=8080 react-scripts start
```
### UI Testing
Tests are run with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) 

```sh
npx react-scripts test --coverage --watchAll=false
```

### API testing
Tests are run inside of a postgresql service and a node service. Between each test the database may need to be reset and reseeded. See aircraft.test for example of how to run do this.

The test utils contains mocks of diffrent user roles that can be passed to the auth header in [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) 

To run the tests. Use :os at the end of these commands if you have not logged in to the hardened registry.

```sh
npm run docker:test
```
